## LED Fade
#### Description 
The Goal of this assignment was to connect a metor express board and wiring an LED to a 220 resistor and have it Fade in and out of brightness. I wired an LED to my Metro board connecting the LED to a 220 resistor and coded it with a new language curcuit python to have it fade in and out. I used duty cycles and PWM in my code in order for it to work.

#### Lessons Learned
Learning this new code came with difficulties. I had to learn how to write 'while true' statements which are similar to 'if then' statements in java script. I had to import libraries such as Pulsio and Digitalio in order for the code to opperate. I had to incorporate PWM and duty cycles which were very difficult. 

PWM is important for the code to function. Here is a fun link [Circuitpython PWM link](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-pwm)

Understanding Duty cycles and how they fit into PWM is crucial heres another helpful link  [Circuitpython dutycycle link](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/shared-bindings/pulseio/PWMOut.html)

## Servo Touch
#### Description 
The purpose of this assignment was to wire a Servo to a Metro express board and code it useing circuitpython to sweep from 180 to 0 degrees and have it controlled by two wires that when one is touched it will move. you will need to use imports such as 'pulsio' 'touchio'. You also need to incorportate PWMout. I used pulsio to create a PWMout object on pin A2. I used touchio to create an object for servo. I then used a "while true' statement to have the servo spin one way if it is above an angle of 180 and the other direction if the angle is below 180.

#### Lessons Learned
 I started my code by incorporating pulsio into my code which was a new library for me. I had trouble with the 'if' statements in this, I learned that I had to contain all of the information about the angle under my object for touchio and its pin to specify when one wire was touched it would move in one dirrection and when the other was touched it would move in the other.

## LCD
#### Description 
In this assignment I had to wire a button and an LCD with backpack to my Metro and when the button is pressed it displays the amount of button presses on an LCD Screen as well as in the serial monitor. Using my java code from last year I modeled my python code off of it. I created a 'while true' statement that said if the button value is 1 (pushed) then it counts and if it is 0 (not Pushed) then it doesnt show on the LCD.

#### Lessons Learned
I had difficulties only extracting certain parts that I needed from a library. I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L6qtSyW94E) to learn how to unzip files and extract certain documents.

## Photo Interrupter
#### Description 
Using a photo interupter wired to a Metro Board Express I counted the amount of times the sensors were interrupted using the serial monitor. Using a counter function I counted the ammount of interupts.

#### Lessons Learned
I had problems with it printing the vaule continuously and not every 4 seconds. I fixed this by creating a variable equal to 4 and using another variable with the code 'time.time' to solve my problem.

## Distance Sensor and Neopixle
#### Description 
In this assignment I wired up a distance sensor to my Metro to sense the distance of an object from it, much like in our ultrasonic robot project from freshmen year. However there was the aditional challenge in this assignment to have the Neopixel on the Metro to light up. When the object was detected close it was red and the farther away it got it went through the rainbow, very pretty! This required me to use mapping in my code and understanding how to create colors in code.

#### Lessons Learned
Although mapping wasn't too difficult to understand you need to have the right resources so heres a 
[link](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/simpleio/en/latest/api.html#simpleio.map_range) Getting the colors right took some research too so heres another [link](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)

## Classes, Objects, and Modules
#### Description 
Here I had to make a class that would set variables and functions that would make prexisiting code on canvas to work. This code enabled two RBG LEDs to fade through all colors of rainbow, once again pretty!

#### Lessons Learned
Making classes was difficult and hard to get used to but once I figured out that what I put in def_int_  needs to be true and will always be running it made a lot more sense.

## Hello vs Code
#### Description
I wrote simple Hello world code into a new program called VS Code and uploaded it to my metro board and then committed and pushed it to Git Hub straight from VS code. I then made a comment of what i had changed.

#### Lessons Learned
It was difficult to learn how to 'git add' and 'commit' but once I realized how to connect Git Hub and Vs code it was a simple click the 'plus sign' to add my code and 'ctrl enter' with a comment of what I did to commit to my git hub repository.

## Fancy LED
#### Description
This combined both the Hello vs Code and Classes, Objects and Modules assignments. In this assignment I wired 6 leds to turn on in specific patterns(alternate, chase, blink, sparkle). There was exisiting code in canvas which I hade to make work by creating a class code in VS code where I detailed the actions of alternate, chase, blink, and sparkle.

#### Lessons Learned
I learned that the ussage of 'for loops' for repeating sections of code helped to clean up my code. I learned that to structure my 'for loop' like this: for i in range(0,5) where 'i' is any variable and 'range' regulates how many times it will repeat. 'For loops' are greate for randomizing code with if statements.  

I referenced [Lily Wielar's github page](https://github.com/lwielar29/CircutPython#fancy-led) to recall what we did in Fancy LED.
